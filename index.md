## Overview

Zoom Market is a full-featured grocery storefront offering browsing, search, cart, checkout, payment processing, order tracking, returns, and administrative tools. This document describes end-user flows, integration points for payments and third-party systems, and developer-facing APIs and webhooks.

## User Journeys

### Browse & Search
Users navigate categories, use faceted search, sort results, and view product listings with availability and price. Search supports keyword, category, brand, and tag filters.

### Product Details
Each product page shows images, descriptions, nutrition info, price, inventory status, seller info, and recommended substitutions. Variants support weight, pack size, and unit conversions.

### Cart
Users add/edit/remove items, change quantities, view line-item pricing, promotions, subtotals, taxes, and shipping estimates. Cart persists for authenticated users and optionally via cookie/session for guests.

### Checkout
Checkout collects shipping address, delivery/pickup options, payment method, and order confirmation. Checkout validates inventory in real-time and reserves stock during payment processing.

## Catalog & Inventory

Key catalog capabilities:

- Hierarchical categories and tags
- Bulk product import (CSV/JSON) and image uploads
- Inventory tracking with available/reserved/committed quantities
- Per-location stock and fulfillment lead times

## Cart & Checkout Details

Checkout flow summary:

1. Review cart → apply coupons / loyalty
2. Collect address & choose fulfillment method (delivery/pickup)
3. Calculate shipping, taxes, and final total
4. Select payment method and submit payment
5. Receive order confirmation and tracking

Instrumented events: `cart.add`, `cart.update`, `checkout.start`, `checkout.complete`, `payment.success`, `payment.failed`.

## Payments & Gateway Integration

### Supported Flows
- Card payments (tokenization + server-side capture)
- Digital wallets (Apple Pay / Google Pay) via gateway
- Saved cards and PCI‑scope reduction via client-side tokenization
- Alternative methods (ACH, BNPL) where supported by the gateway

### Integration Pattern (recommended)
1. Client obtains ephemeral payment token via gateway SDK.
2. Client sends token + order details to your server.
3. Server validates order, reserves inventory, calls gateway capture API.
4. On gateway webhook success, mark order paid and finalize fulfillment.


### Security & Compliance
- Never store raw card data; use gateway tokens or vault.
- Use HTTPS and HSTS for all endpoints.
- Sign and verify webhooks; rotate secrets periodically.
- Follow PCI DSS guidance; prefer hosted fields or gateway SDKs.

## Orders & Fulfillment

Order lifecycle: NEW → PROCESSING → PICKED → SHIPPED/OUT_FOR_DELIVERY → DELIVERED → RETURNED/REFUNDED. Support partial shipments, tracking numbers, cancellations and refunds with reconciliation against payment gateway records.

## Accounts & Profiles

Features: registration/login (email/password, OAuth), address book, saved payments (tokens), order history, loyalty points, notification preferences.

## Admin & Reporting

Admin capabilities include product management, inventory adjustments, order management, returns processing, reports (sales, refunds, inventory turnover), and staff permissions/roles.


## Security & Compliance

- Enforce strong authentication and RBAC for admin endpoints.
- Use TLS everywhere and secure cookies (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite).
- Rate-limit public APIs and implement WAF rules for common attacks.
- Log security events and monitor fraud patterns (velocity, mismatched IP & billing address).

## Deployment & Testing

Recommendations:

- Use separate environments (dev, staging, prod) and test payment flows with sandbox credentials.
- Automate integration and contract tests for APIs and webhooks.
- Test failure modes: payment declines, webhook retries, inventory race conditions.
- Monitor metrics: order rate, cart abandonment, payment failures, latency.

## Getting Started — Quick Checklist

1. Clone the repository and open this documentation.
2. Set up the database and apply initial schema (see Installation docs).
3. Configure payment gateway sandbox credentials and webhook endpoint.
4. Import product catalog and verify inventory counts.
5. Run an end-to-end test order through checkout and verify fulfillment.
