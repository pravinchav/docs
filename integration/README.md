# RetailProcessor API Documentation (Third‑Party Integration)

This document contains integration guides for the public APIs exposed by RetailProcessor. Each document includes endpoint details, required headers, sample requests (curl), example responses, and integration notes.

## APIs

- [Upload Products](./upload-products.md) — Instructions and sample payloads for uploading product data (CSV or JSON), field mappings, validation rules, and common errors.
- [Upload Product Images](./upload-product-images.md) — Guide for uploading product images using multipart/form-data, naming conventions, and size/format requirements.
- [Receive Orders](./receive-orders.md) — Details on pulling orders from RetailProcessor (GET endpoints), pagination, filters, and sample responses.
- [Send Orders](./send-orders.md) — Steps and examples for pushing orders into RetailProcessor (POST), required headers, idempotency notes, and error handling.
- [Send Invoices](./upload-invoices.md) — How to upload invoice PDF files (multipart), expected metadata, and downstream processing behavior.

Integration notes

- All requests require authentication. Include an Authorization header with a bearer token (or as specified by your agreement).
- Many endpoints expect an encrypted company key header (named `key`) — see each doc for details.
- For file uploads, use multipart/form-data with proper Content-Type boundaries.
- For downloads, the API returns Content-Type: application/pdf and Content-Disposition: attachment.

If you need a machine-readable OpenAPI (Swagger) file, request it from the API owner.
